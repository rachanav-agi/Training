        A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and
        the developer. Many web sites contain HTML code like to indicate
        navigation, header, and footer.

        WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural
        environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with
        nature.

        animal kingdom is unique among eukaryotic organisms because most animal
        tissues are bound together in an extracellular matrix by a triple helix
        of protein known as collagen. Plant and fungal cells are bound together
        in tissues or aggregations by other molecules, such as pectin. The fact
        that no other organisms utilize collagen in this manner is one of the
        indications that all animals arose from a common unicellular ancestor.
        Bones, shells, spicules, and other hardened structures are formed when
        the collagen-containing extracellular matrix between animal cells
        becomes calcified.

        Centrioles are self-replicating organelles made up of nine bundles of
        microtubules and are found only in animal cells. They appear to help in
        organizing cell division, but aren't essential to the process.
